# NY Citibike with Tableau

Link to my Tableau Story: 

## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
After experiencing Citi Bikes in New York City, Kate wants to start a similar bike share business in her hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. She found a potential angel investor who might be interested in providing seed funding. Now she needs help figuring out how the business works in NYC and how it might work in Des Moines. Using Tableau, I created a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. I started by importing, styling, and portraying NYC Citi Bike trip data accurately. Then I created worksheets and dashboards to put together a story that visualizes key data from the dataset.

## Results

### Two Additional Recommendations
- For future development, Dana could consider adding a count of how many results are returned whenever a new search criteria is entered.
- Another possibility would be to create a filter that searches for specific words in the 'Comment' column.
